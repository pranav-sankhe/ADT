The tabla is a percussion instrument of the Indian subcontinent, consisting of a pair of drums, used in traditional, classical, popular and folk music. The audio of tabla is composed of many modalities. We wish to develop an end to end transcription system for tabla audio and to reconstruct the audio from the obtained transcription. We also intend to study the presence of (acoustic-prosodic) correspondences between the recitation and playing of tabla compositions like intensity and F0 variations, at the bol/stroke level (sort of like word-level in speech) and identify those that are well-correlated. In particular for music education, it would be useful to provide a rating and to identify the nature of the error in the learning process.  \\ 
Recently data driven signal processing approaches have been gaining momentum to solve problems like the one elaborated above. The use of machine learning to solve complex non linear problems have been dominating the speech and music research which is evident in the recently published papers. In particular, we have explored the use of NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) to solve the problem of drum transcription for drum-only-recordings. While this approach works significantly well, having seen the developments in DNN models for Piano transcription, we are motivated to employ a similar architecture for tabla transcription. \\ 
There are few challenges in implementing a neural network architecture for tabla transcription which we will elaborate over in later sections.  We intend to find a way around these challenges and come up with a suitable and robust transcription and evaluation system. \\
