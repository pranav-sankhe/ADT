The Tabla Solo dataset is a parallel corpus comprising time-aligned syllabic scores and audio-recordings of 38 solo tabla compositions. The audio and scores for these recordings is from the instructional video DVD titled Shades of Tabla by Pt. Arvind Mulgaonkar. If you use the dataset in your work, please cite the following publication:

=== Dataset organization ===
For each composition, the dataset contains the audio file, score, and time aligned onset annotations of strokes with and without stroke mapping. The files corresponding to a particular composition have the same name, with different extensions. 

The dataset folder is organized as follows: 
1. filelist.txt: List of compositions
2. syllableMapping.pdf: The pdf showing the mapping used to reduce the syllable space from 41 syllables to 18 syllable groups. 
3. Folder /wav/ contains all the wav files, named <filename>.wav 
4. Folder /score/ contains all the scores, named (<filename>.txt)
5. Folder /onsNoMap/ contains time aligned onset annotations without mapping, named (<filename>.csv)
6. Folder /onsMap/ contains time aligned onset annotations with mapping, named (<filename>.csv)
