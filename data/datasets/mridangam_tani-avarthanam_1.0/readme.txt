A couple of notes about the dataset :- 

* There are two tanis - STE005.wav and STE-007.wav. Both have been recorded in a closed room using a Zoom H4n recorder with two microphones : SM 57 for the treble head and SM 58 for the base head of the mridangam. The recorded audio is stereo with a sampling rate of 44.1KHz.

* The recordings themselves can be found at original_recordings/ directory.
