Naming convention:

<Bol>_<Variation number>_<Loud or Soft (l/s)>_<Repetition number>.wav

e.g.: 'Na_1_s_3.wav' is the Na stroke of type 1 played softly, the third time.

Note: 'Trkt' is the phrase Ti-Ra-Ki-Ta of 4 bols. It is kept as a single entity because of the frequent occurence of this pattern in compositions.
